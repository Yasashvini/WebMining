# WebMining
Applying the light GBM model on fraud detection dataset. This project was done by **Yasashvini(17BCE1077) and Anisha Chazhoor(17BCE1053)**
**The training dataset and the testing dataset are too big to be uploaded into the repository.** 
So I'm sharing the link from where the dataset can be dowloaded https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/data or use the command: kaggle competitions download -c ieee-fraud-detection

**ABOUT THE PROJECT:**
In this project, a technique for CIS IEEE fraud detection is developed. Credit card is quite useful for our day to day life. The goal is to detect least and accurate fraud detection. There are several methods for detecting credit card fraud like Group method of data handling, Bayesian learning and Neural network. Our method shall use Light GBM model where the tree is grown vertically to predict if a credit card is a fraud or not.
